-> Software Design -> OOP -> Design Patterns

What is software design?

Whag is Object Oriented Programming?

- Everything is a class
- Everytime assigns values (attributes) to a class to create an object 
- When creating / reading (heavily) / updating / deleting external sources, we will invoke the functions (behaviours) of the object

Purpose of software `design`.

What do we expect from Object Oriented Programming?

-> A new requirement comes > change little / no change of system

-> The change of requirement is proportional to the amount of change of the system

-> Facitiliate to add new codes instead of modifying the existing codes as much as possible
