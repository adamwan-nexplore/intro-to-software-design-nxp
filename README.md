What is software design?
What OOP can help?
What is OOP?

Purpose of software `design`.

No design = procedural programming (just a series of programming statements to command computer to execute) -> hard to understand


=> a bit design (group the statements into functions) -> hard to understand

=> group the functions into namespace (class)

＝> change of features

=> how it impact the interfaces

=> how it impact the way to verify it

Object Oriented Programming is one of the ways to rearrange the programs so that we can build an easy-to-change software that fits what we want with confidence.

basically -> introduce some places to change, those parts will be restricted by class signatures and 

Inflection point
beyond certain complexity the design is uselss and wont pay off.
